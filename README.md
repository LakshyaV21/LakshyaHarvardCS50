Here is my GitHub repository where I have documented my code for the Harvard CS50: Intro to Computer Science Course.

Tips for Self-Learners:
-Link what you learned each week to every action you have to accomplish in the problem set. 
-Always have the CS50 library of functions open to use if you find it overwhelming to think on your own. 
-The CS50 duck is an amazing way to clarify your doubts.
